/**
 * Initializes Timer A3 in edge time mode to trigger interrupts on
 * the rising edges of P10.4 (TA3CCR0) and P10.5 (TA3CCR1). When an interrupt occurs,
 * the corresponding user-defined function is called with the current timer value.
 *
 * @param task0 Pointer to the function that will be called when a rising edge is detected on P10.4 (TA3CCR0).
 *              The function takes a 16-bit timer value (in units of 2/3 microseconds) as its parameter.
 * @param task1 Pointer to the function that will be called when a rising edge is detected on P10.5 (TA3CCR1).
 *              The function takes a 16-bit timer value (in units of 2/3 microseconds) as its parameter.
 *
 * @return None.
 *
 * @note Assumes that the low-speed subsystem master clock (SMCLK) is running at 12 MHz.
