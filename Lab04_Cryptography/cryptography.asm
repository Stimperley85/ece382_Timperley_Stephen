;------------ Encrypt ------------
; This subroutine takes the address of a plain text message and a key,
;   then encrypts the message by performing an XOR operation.
;   The encrypted result is stored at the specified memory location.
;   The encryption stops when EOM is encountered.
;
; Inputs:
;   R0 - Address of the plain text message
;   R1 - Key for XOR encryption
;   R2 - Address to store the encrypted message
;
; Return:
;   None
Encrypt:   .asmfunc
; ============ Add your code and comments below ===================

    ; Use EOM defined at line 44 for '#'




    ; You must use the XOR_bytes function for exclusive or!
    BL XOR_bytes        ; XOR_Bytes





; =============== End of your code ================================
    .endasmfunc


;------------ Decrypt ------------
; This subroutine takes the address of an encrypted message and a key,
;   then decrypts the message by performing an XOR operation.
;   The decrypted result is stored at the specified memory location.
;   The decryption stops when the EOM is encountered.
;
; Inputs:
;   R0 - Address of the encrypted message
;   R1 - Key for XOR decryption
;   R2 - Address to store the decrypted message
;
; Return:
;   None
