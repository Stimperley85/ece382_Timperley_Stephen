/**
 * This code performs prime number checking on an array of positive integers
 * and stores the results in another array. The process involves iterating
 * through the array of integers and determining whether each number is prime
 * or composite. It does so by checking if the number is divisible by any
 * integer between 2 and half of the number's value (i.e., n/2).
